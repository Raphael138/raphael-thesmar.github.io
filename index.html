                    I am a senior at Cornell University, double majoring in Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering. My current research focuses on applying computer vision to medicine under the guidance of Pf. Mert Sabuncu, as well as exploring large language models with Pf. Kilian Weinberger.

                    I am interested in <strong>multimodal learning</strong>, and in machine learning model <strong>reasoning</strong> and <strong>interpretability</strong>. Language models require trillions of training tokens to exhibit commonsense reasoning, whereas humans are far more data-efficient. My interest thus lies in exploiting multiple modalities to create more efficient systems. Additionally, I am interested in researching machine learning models' causal reasoning and logical abilities, particularly across modalities. As for my interest in interpretability, it lies in creating consistent methods to explain black-box model reasoning and leveraging interpretability to create systems which mimic the causal and reasoning systems of humans or even field-specific specialists.

                    Outside of academics, I enjoy playing basketball and soccer, running, and reading a good book. Some of my favorites include <em>The Dark Forest</em> and <em>Crime and Punishment</em>. I’m also a fan of binge-watching great shows and eating, but not so much the cooking aspect.
